            <h2>About .code</h2>
            <p>.code was made in January, 2026 made to help people learn programming and connect with others in the coding community.
                Our mission is to create a big community of programmers from all skill levels where they can share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and grow together as developers.
                Originally Made By: Balint
                We want to empower the future generation of Programmers by providing a supportive and engaging environment where they can thrive.

            <h2>Why .code Was Created</h2>
            <p>.code was created to bridge the gap between learning and practicing programming. It provides a platform where beginners can start their journey and experienced developers can share their knowledge and collaborate on projects.
                 The goal is to make programming accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.</p>
                 At first .code was just a small Project that no one knew could grow. But you can help us make it grow even more by joining our Discord Server.
